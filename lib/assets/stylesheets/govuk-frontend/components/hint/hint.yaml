  When used with a single input, the hint MUST:
  - be announced by screen readers when the input is focussed

  When used with a group of multiple inputs (such as within a fieldset), the
  hint MUST:
  - be announced by screen readers when focussing the first input within the
    group (first in this case refers to the focus order, not the DOM - if the
    user is traversing backwards through the page then this would be the last
    input within the group in the DOM)

  When used with a group of multiple inputs, the hint SHOULD NOT:
  - be announced every time for each individual input

examples:
- name: default
  data:
    text: |
      It’s on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60.
      For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
- name: with html
  data:
    html: |
      It’s on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or <a class="govuk-link" href="#">P60</a>.
      For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
