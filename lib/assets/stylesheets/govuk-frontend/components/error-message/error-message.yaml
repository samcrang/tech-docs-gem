accessibilityCriteria: |
  When used with a single input, the error message MUST:
  - be announced by screen readers when the input is focussed

  When used with a group of multiple inputs (such as within a fieldset), the
  error message MUST:
  - be announced by screen readers when focussing the first input within the
    group (first in this case refers to the focus order, not the DOM - if the
    user is traversing backwards through the page then this would be the last
    input within the group in the DOM)

  When used with a group of multiple inputs, the error message SHOULD NOT:
  - be announced every time for each individual input

examples:
- name: default
  data:
    text: Error message about full name goes here
